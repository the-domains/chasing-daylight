  The main town where old pre-war colonial houses abound, this Silay - Airport

### _Historical Silay City_

The main town where old pre-war colonial houses abound, this Silay - Airport road is the entrance into the Guimbalaon and Lantawan corridor leading to Patag, a mountain village where the last of the Japanese army held out during the second world war. It's 29 kilometres to the summit so make sure to go at just the right pace to have some gas left in the tank for the challenging climbs starting from Guimbalaon, about 20 kilometres from El Ideal---the oldest cafe in Negros, open for business since 1920\.
