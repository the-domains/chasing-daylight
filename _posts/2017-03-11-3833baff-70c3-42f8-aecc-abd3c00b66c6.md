  The penultimate climb on the road to Lantawan, this section will challenge
  even the toughest of climbers. Make sure you have the right gearing and enough
  power and energy in the legs to take this zigzagging wall of a climb. Be
  careful of incoming vehicular traffic if you opt to weave due to the steep
  blind corner. Not an ordinary climb for the novice rider but persevere and you
  will be rewarded with a most expansive, most beautiful vista of the western
  coast of North Negros and the surrounding coastal views.
