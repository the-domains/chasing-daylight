Road to Gawahon

With 26 kilometres from the town of Victorias to the first waterfalls of Gawahon, the road is relatively flat for the first 5 kilometres allowing for a long warm up. Seven kilometres in will show an average gradient of 2%, gradually increasing until kilometre 14 right after Estado, where the road begins to rise to around 5% - 7%. After the overflow crossing, the real work begins at kilometre 16 where the road turns straight up, all the way to the mountain resort of Gawahon, climbing steadily for the next 8 kms until you hit the welcome arch. Those that have some gas left in the tank can attempt to go straight to the first falls with uphill climbs under the cover of canopy. Take care and mind the moss patches on the roads approaching the entry all the way to the first falls. This is an extremely challenging climb with a rewarding waterfall access for willing riders.
